As a non-registered user, I want to create an account in order to log in onto the website, leave comments, and see recommendations based on future searches. It requires the user to input their email address and account number, a password and account name as wished. If success, I will be using my email and created password to log in. If the email address I registered is used already, I would not be able to complete the registration of account.
