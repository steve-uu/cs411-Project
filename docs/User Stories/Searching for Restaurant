As a user, I want to be able to search for restaurants near my location in order to choose where to go eat. 
This would work by opening up the application and entering into the prompted search bar key terms for the type of restaurant I want 
(i.e. Type of cuisine, Price point, Takeout Availability, etc.). 
The map would then list the top restaurants according to my search query.
I would then be able to choose a restaurant to learn more details about it (address, phone number, hours open)
and to see tweets from people about the restaurant (tweets taken from Twitter). 
These details and tweets would help me make a decision of which restaurant I would choose to go eat at. 
What was mentioned is the success story. Non-success would be if no Restaurant is available based on the search terms, 
to which a notification would be given saying “no results found nearby. Please adjust search criteria”
